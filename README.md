This repository contains the code for a final project on A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithm for autonomous navigation with a camera mounted on it. The code mainly uses two libraries: PyTorch for developing and training the neural network and AI2Thor for realistic simulation of the physical world.
