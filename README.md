# PEARL (Personal Environment Autonomous Reinforcement Learning)

This repository contains the code for a final project on A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) algorithm for autonomous navigation with a camera mounted on it. The code mainly uses two libraries: PyTorch for developing and training the neural network and AI2Thor for realistic simulation of the physical world. 

## Installation

#### Requirements

- **Python:** 3.9 or later
- **Operating system**: Unix system, Mac OS X 10.9 or later
